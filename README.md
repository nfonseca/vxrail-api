# vxrail-api
Main Repository For VxRail API Bodies Requests

## Introduction

The content of this repository consists of a few json body files that need to be provided to VxRail API in order to run some POST API Calls.
There is also a python script that leverages the built-in VxRail API's to manage one or more VxRail Clusters from a central location.
